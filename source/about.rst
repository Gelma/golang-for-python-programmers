Author
======

`Jason McVetta`_ is an independent consultant, teacher, and Free Software
activist based in beautiful-but-too-cold San Francisco.  He studied government
and philosophy in college, but was unwilling to sell his soul to the
Demopublicratican Party, so he went to work in software. After 12 years as a
professional Pythonist he met his new love, Go.   He is able to fly without
mechanical assistance.


Payment
=======

This is a Free book, but you are more than welcome to pay me for it!  You are
under no obligation, legal or moral, to do so. But I can always use a couple
bucks for coffee.  =)
